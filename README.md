# Process
1. Attempted the assignments myself
2. When I stumbled, I used chatgpt to try to help me figure out some of the problems I had
3. When I came to a point where I knew I need help, I posted my code, streamlit view, and description of the problem
4. Implement advice
### Note:
If you run into a new problem, I rinse and repeated these 4 steps




# Experience
* The community of Radical AI is super welcoming

* I am surprised how fast Wilfredo Aaron Sosa Ramos responds to everyone ðŸ˜‚

* The assignments were definitely tough for me. Although I had experience with streamlit and tensorflow, I didn't with lanchain

* Surprisingly, the retention that you get from these assignments is great because of how much fun you have despite hitting your head against the keyboard 

* It took me about 12 days to finish all of my assignments

In the end, You don't have to resort to this
